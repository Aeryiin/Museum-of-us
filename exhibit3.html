          <!--INTRO-->
          Happy valentines day, my love, my baby, my future! I'm really sorry I wasn't able to get you a physical gift but
          I hope this one still feels special. This is our first valentines together, and even
          though it didn't go the way we expected, I'm still so grateful I got to spend it with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!--BODY-->
          I'm honestly finding it a bit difficult to put my feelings into words because I don't want to
          just repeat the letter I gave you before. I want this to be honest and real. What we've been going
          through hasn't been easy — the fighting, bickering, disagreements, misunderstandings. We both know
          how tiring it's been. But in spite of all that, we still chose each other. Even when things felt
          like they were falling apart, we stayed. And I hope we keep choosing each other. Becuase honestly,
          I really hope it's me and you. I hope we're there for each other when we graduate, when we get our
          first paychecks, when we save up and finally live under one roof. I hope we get to cuddle every night,
          cook together, have move nights, and stay at home when we both don't feel like going out. 
          I hope in the small moments where we're tired, sad, angry, or overwhelmed, I'm the one beside you, 
          holding you and listening. And I hope I get to be that person for you the same way you've been that person for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- BODY -->
          I've also realized something about you, and this is you always fail to meet my expectations. In the way that I expect 
          to be misunderstood. I expect distance. I expect to fight just to be heard. And every single time, you surprise me by not
          being the person I was bracing myself against. You choose patience. You choose to listen. You choose
          to stay calm. And in doing that, you make me feel seen, heard, understood, and deeply loved.
          Thank you for choosing to understand me. For choosing to listen. For choosing to
          stay by my side, and especially, for choosing me. Even if you say that it's the bare minimum or whatever
          , I am endlessly grateful to have you come into my life and treat me with kindness, consistency, and patience.
          I didn't always expect to be met with such gentleness, and having you has changed that for me. I really hope I make you feel the 
          same way. Even when I'm masungit, or when I tease you or play fight with you, I hope you know underneath all of that, I 
          feel safe with you. And I hope I make you feel just as safe with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- BODY -->
          It amazes me how we went from being just friends to this. I remember our first one-on-one conversation
          with each other at SM, you know the one I never fail to bring up every time. I was so genuinely happy to
          have talked with you like that and that you became my friend. I realize that I've felt safe with you
          even before we got together. I always felt so warm and happy when I got to talk to you or play with you,
          just us two. I started looking for you in every gala my friends had. "Si RB sasama?" "Ayain niyo
          si RB." And somewhere along the way, the thought of us possibly getting together in the future started crossing my mind, but 
          I tried to ignore it and listed the reasons why we wouldn't be compatible just to convince myself it was nothing (It was 
          the time we were on call together with Ren, and I was asking you both a bunch of questions about what you want in a girl. I don't 
          think you'll remember but yeah). But I was obviously very wrong because, well, look at us now. Somehow, in the most unexpected
          way, we still found our way to each other. And I wouldn't change that for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- CONCLUSION -->
          I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for us, I'm excited to grow with you and live life
          with each other by our side. You have no idea how thankful I am that we crossed paths and somehow
          you became someone very important to me. I love you so much mahal ko, forever and always.
